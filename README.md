This was the TIP CALCULATOR APP. 
My Goal was provide to continue to improve in my JavaScript skills while I keep brushing up on my HTML and CSS ðŸ‘‹

This simple web application collects the total bill and provides the amount each diner will pay in tips and total amount


Methodology

I developed the HTML by using SEMANTIC HTML elements for SEO and accesibility. 

My process of solving this problem involved using semantical HTML to section the structure of the single page I also use CSS to make the layout responsive with break points set to 756px. I opted for the flexbox approach and as usual went mobile first.

JavaScript Approach

My approach was to declare all the DOM elements critical to this design at the start of the js script- inputs and buttons.

Made use of add event listeners for the buttons and input 

Worked on making my JS script DRY by making use of returning functions for the add event listener functions

Lessons learned

Being able to research to detect bugs in your code. Experienced that with my JS code with my click button firing twice.
